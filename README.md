## Amstelhaege
In this repository you can find our possible solutions for the heuristics problem 'Amstelhaege', which deals with finding the right algorithm for the construction of a new residential area in a way that is as profitable as possible.
The restrictions of the construction of this new residential area are as follows:
* The total amount of houses must consist of 60% single-family homes, 25% bungalows and 15% maisons, which not only differ in dimensions but also differ in what extent it must be free-standing with regard to other houses. The more extra distance in between houses, the higher the increase in value of the house, since every extra meter leads to a priceincrease of 3% (single-family homes) , 4% (bungalows) or 6% (maisons).
* Twenty percent of the area is reserved for water surfaces that can be divided into a maximum of four bodies, each of which must have a height-width ratio between 1 and 4.
The objective is to eventually create a map with the most profitable layout of the residential area, for an amount of 20, 40 and 60 houses. The score for a map is the sum of the final values of the houses.
