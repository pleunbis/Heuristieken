## Guide
This repository contains four folders: *Hillclimber*, *Hillclimber + Simulated annealing*, *Random* and *Simulated annealing*

Every folder contains folders for every version of AmstelHaege (20, 40 or 60 houses). In there, you will find outcomes (under *Data*) and visualizations of the algorithms used.
